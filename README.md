This project was created for the Artificial Intelligence course in university. Its aim is to study and explore the kmeans and knn methods for image recognition.
Its inspiration is the use of a camera in a supermarket checkout to identify fruits.

It consists of analyzing and filtering the photos with opencv library for python to get the necessary information and form the clusters. Then we compare and see the results.
